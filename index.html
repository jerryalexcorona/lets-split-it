        <h2>Welcome to Let's Split It!</h2>
        <p>I created this tool to help me split my paycheck into several different accounts. Before spending any money, I enter the amount I received. Then, I specify how many accounts to divide it into. Here are the accounts I split it into: rent, travel, taxes, investments, emergencies, donations, savings, and my spending money. If I need to save for something new, like a phone or laptop, I can easily add another split.</p>
        <p>I know this might seem a bit extreme for some, but you can start with two and increase the splits as needed.</p>
        <p>Planning a vacation? Need a new car? Saving for a house down payment? Trying to pay off credit card debt? Whatever your goal, simply add another split and allocate money towards it.</p>
        <p>I made it simple so you can split the total by fixed dollar amounts or percentages. For example, let's say every paycheck I allocate $600 to my first split, which I'll call rent. Then, I set aside $200 in my spending account for daily expenses until the next payday. My third split, named savings, receives 50%, and my fourth split, travel, gets 40%. The remaining amount goes into my final split for donations.</p>
        <p>Itâ€™s that simple.</p>
        <p>This tool removes the guesswork from budgeting without the need for constant calculations. I can easily see how much is allocated to each split.</p>
        <p>This tool has completely transformed my financial life, and I want to share it with you. I'd love to hear if it helps you with your finances. Share this tool with your friends and family, because, I believe, we do better when we all do better.</p>
        <p>Let's take the first step towards a better financial future.</p>
        <p>...You can also use it to split the bar tab, split the restaurant check, split the birthday gift, or anything else you can think of.</p>
